In this repository, I am creating very basic html pages that I have learned from The Odin Projects as their first html assignment. I chose 3 random recipes to make pages for and they are all linked through an index.html page. In the recipe pages, I practice with different headings, adding a jpg image with alts, putting in paragraphs and using some bold fonts as well as making unordered and ordered lists.

The fundamentals are just the beginning of a great learning journey ahead!
