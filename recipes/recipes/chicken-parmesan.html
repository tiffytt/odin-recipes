    <h4>Chicken Parmesan</h4>

    <p>Chicken Parmesan is one of the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. Despite its fancy looks, it's easy to make at home. Chicken Parmesan is probably even better to make at home in your kitchen. This recipe has the perfect chicken to sauce ratio so that it is not just a soggy piece of chicken and cheese.</p>

    <p>This recipe does not overwhelm the chicken with all of the sauce and cheese like most recipes. The trick to a good Chicken Parmesan is to not put any sauce beneath the chicken cutlets, and just to add a little bit of sauce on the top so that the breading stays nice and crispy. Another great way to enjoy this is by adding grated Parmesan to the breadcrumb mixture, which adds even more flavor. Here are the instructions on how to make this great recipe.</p>
