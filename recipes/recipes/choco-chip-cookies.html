    <h4>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies</h4>

    <p>There is nothing like a warm and melty chocolate chip cookie for dessert or pretty much any time of the day. The best chocolate chip cookie is one straight from the oven made with your own hands and hard-work. Just kidding, this recipe is not hard-work at all but it is still easy and will leave you with some of the best chocolate chip cookies you ever had, especially if you put some love into it. This will be a big hit not only for you, but for your family and friends to enjoy as well.</p>

    <p>A few tips to making these chocolate chip cookies good is to definitely let the dough rest in the fridge for a few hours or even better, in the freezer over-night <strong>(Just make sure you pre-roll them in a wrap, like the ones you see in the grocery store!).</strong>However, if you absolutey cannot wait, then a half-hour in the fridge should be fine as well. Another good tip is to make sure you take the cookies out at the finish mark of the timer, don't worry if it looks under-cooked as the cookies will still continue to bake from the residual heat and this prevents it from it getting burnt!
